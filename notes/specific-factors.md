# Specific-Factors Model (Full Notes)

## 0. Executive idea
The Specific-Factors model is the short-run trade model. Labor moves between sectors, but other factors are stuck. Price changes reallocate labor and change factor returns, creating winners and losers. This is the core model for distributional conflict and trade politics.

## 1. Setup and assumptions
**Sectors**:
- Manufacturing (M): uses labor $L_M$ and capital $K$
- Agriculture (A): uses labor $L_A$ and land $T$

**Factors**:
- Labor is mobile across sectors
- Capital is specific to M
- Land is specific to A

**Technologies**:
- $Q_M = F(K, L_M)$
- $Q_A = G(T, L_A)$

**Resource constraint**:
- $L_M + L_A = L$
- $K, T$ fixed in short run

## 2. Equilibrium conditions
Firms hire labor until value marginal product equals wage:

$$P_M MPL_M = w, \quad P_A MPL_A = w$$

Thus labor allocation satisfies:

$$P_M MPL_M = P_A MPL_A$$

Because MPLs diminish, the PPF is concave.

---

## 3. Marginal products (Cobb-Douglas case)
Assume:

$$Q_M = K^\alpha L_M^{1-\alpha}, \quad Q_A = T^\beta L_A^{1-\beta}$$

Then:

$$MPL_M = (1-\alpha)K^\alpha L_M^{-\alpha}$$

$$MPL_A = (1-\beta)T^\beta L_A^{-\beta}$$

The labor allocation condition becomes:

$$P_M(1-\alpha)K^\alpha L_M^{-\alpha} = P_A(1-\beta)T^\beta L_A^{-\beta}$$

Solve together with $L_M + L_A = L$.

## 4. Price shock analysis (core mechanism)
Suppose $P_M$ rises with $P_A$ fixed.

Step-by-step:
1. Manufacturing becomes more profitable.
2. Labor shifts from A to M.
3. $MPL_M$ falls, $MPL_A$ rises.
4. Wage rises, but less than $P_M$.

**Key result**: labor's real wage effect is ambiguous.

- In terms of M: $w/P_M$ falls (since $w$ rises less than $P_M$).
- In terms of A: $w/P_A$ rises (since $w$ rises).

## 5. Returns to specific factors
Define returns:

$$r_K = P_M MPK_M, \quad r_T = P_A MPT_A$$

When $P_M$ rises:
- $r_K$ increases more than proportionally (magnification effect)
- $r_T$ decreases

**Conclusion**: Specific factor in expanding sector gains, specific factor in contracting sector loses.

---

## 6. Trade opening (distributional result)
If the country has comparative advantage in M, opening to trade raises $P_M/P_A$.

Therefore:
- Capital owners gain (export sector)
- Landowners lose (import-competing sector)
- Workers ambiguous

This is the main political-economy insight: trade policy coalitions form around sector-specific factors.

---

## 7. Worked directional example
Let $P_M$ rise by 10%.

Predictions:
- $L_M$ rises, $L_A$ falls
- $w$ rises less than 10%
- $r_K$ rises more than 10%
- $r_T$ falls

---

## 8. Graphical intuition
- Concave PPF due to diminishing MPLs
- Relative price changes move the economy along the PPF
- Distributional effects follow sectoral expansion/contraction

---

## 9. Common pitfalls
- Treating this as a long-run model (it is short-run).
- Claiming labor gains unambiguously (it does not).
- Forgetting that price changes move labor allocation via MPLs.

---

## 10. Summary paragraph
The Specific-Factors model describes a short-run economy where labor is mobile but other factors are stuck in their sectors. Equilibrium requires $P_M MPL_M = P_A MPL_A$. A rise in the price of one good draws labor into that sector, raises wages by less than the price increase, and generates clear distributional effects: the specific factor in the expanding sector gains, the specific factor in the contracting sector loses, and labor’s real wage effect is ambiguous. This model explains why trade generates winners and losers and why trade politics are sector-based in the short run.
