# The Specific Factors Model

> **Big Idea**: In the short run, some factors are stuck in particular industries (specific factors). Trade creates winners and losers based on which industry you're in, not just which factor type you own. This explains why some industries lobby for protection while others support free trade.

---

## Core Principles

### Foundation
- **Multiple Factors**: Three factors of production: Labor (L), Capital (K), and Land (T)
  - Unlike Ricardian (one factor) but simpler than HO (factor mobility)
- **Factor Specificity**: Capital and land are specific to sectors; labor is mobile
  - Capital (K) can only be used in manufacturing
  - Land (T) can only be used in agriculture
  - Labor (L) can move between sectors
- **Short-Run Model**: Reflects short-run where some factors cannot move between sectors
  - Factories can't instantly become farms
  - But workers can switch jobs (with some friction)
- **Diminishing Returns**: Each sector exhibits diminishing marginal product of mobile factor
  - Adding more workers to fixed capital/land → declining productivity
  - Implies concave PPF
- **Perfect Competition**: All markets are perfectly competitive
  - Price-taking firms
  - Factors paid their marginal products

### Why This Model Matters
- Introduces **distributional conflict** from trade (winners and losers)
  - Not everyone gains like in Ricardian model
- More realistic short-run analysis than Ricardian model
  - Captures adjustment costs and industry-specific interests
- Explains political economy of trade policy
  - Why steel workers oppose imports but tech workers don't
- Bridge between Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models
  - Combines technology with factor ownership

## Model Setup

### Two Sectors
1. **Manufacturing (M)**: Uses labor (Lₘ) and capital (K)
2. **Agriculture (A)**: uses labor (Lₐ) and land (T)

### Production Functions
**Manufacturing**: Qₘ = F(K, Lₘ)
- K is fixed (specific to manufacturing)
- Exhibits diminishing marginal product: ∂Qₘ/∂Lₘ = MPLₘ > 0, ∂²Qₘ/∂Lₘ² < 0

**Agriculture**: Qₐ = G(T, Lₐ)
- T is fixed (specific to agriculture)
- Exhibits diminishing marginal product: ∂Qₐ/∂Lₐ = MPLₐ > 0, ∂²Qₐ/∂Lₐ² < 0

### Resource Constraints
**Labor market clearing**: Lₘ + Lₐ = L (total labor endowment)

**Specific factors**: K and T are fixed in their respective sectors

## Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

### Shape
- **Concave** (bowed out from origin)
- Reflects increasing opportunity cost due to diminishing returns

### Slope
At any point on PPF:
**Slope** = -MPLₐ/MPLₘ = -(Marginal cost of agriculture)/(Marginal cost of manufacturing)

### Derivation
As labor moves from M to A:
- ΔQₐ = MPLₐ · ΔLₐ
- ΔQₘ = -MPLₘ · ΔLₘ = -MPLₘ · ΔLₐ (since ΔLₘ = -ΔLₐ)

**Opportunity cost**: |ΔQₘ/ΔQₐ| = MPLₘ/MPLₐ

This increases as more labor moves to agriculture (diminishing returns).

## Autarky Equilibrium

### Profit Maximization
Each sector hires labor until:
- **Manufacturing**: Pₘ · MPLₘ = w
- **Agriculture**: Pₐ · MPLₐ = w

where w is the wage rate.

### Labor Market Equilibrium
Setting wages equal across sectors:

**Pₘ · MPLₘ = Pₐ · MPLₐ = w**

This determines the allocation of labor (Lₘ, Lₐ).

### Goods Market Equilibrium
Relative price Pₘ/Pₐ adjusts so that:
- Production equals consumption in both goods
- Economy operates on the PPF

## Factor Prices and Returns

### Labor (Mobile Factor)
**Nominal wage**: w = Pₘ · MPLₘ = Pₐ · MPLₐ

**Real wage in terms of manufactures**: w/Pₘ = MPLₘ

**Real wage in terms of agriculture**: w/Pₐ = MPLₐ

### Capital (Specific to Manufacturing)
**Nominal return**: r = (Pₘ · Qₘ - w · Lₘ)/K

**Real return**: r/Pₘ or r/Pₐ

### Land (Specific to Agriculture)
**Nominal return**: rₜ = (Pₐ · Qₐ - w · Lₐ)/T

**Real return**: rₜ/Pₘ or rₜ/Pₐ

## Effects of Price Changes: Stolper-Samuelson (Specific Factors Version)

### Scenario: Pₘ increases (Pₐ held constant)

#### Step 1: Labor Reallocation
- Initially: Pₘ · MPLₘ = w (old equilibrium)
- After price increase: Pₘ↑ · MPLₘ > w
- Manufacturing sector wants to hire more labor
- Labor flows from agriculture to manufacturing: Lₐ → Lₘ

#### Step 2: Marginal Products Adjust
- MPLₘ falls (diminishing returns as Lₘ rises)
- MPLₐ rises (diminishing returns as Lₐ falls)

#### Step 3: New Wage Equilibrium
**New wage**: w' = Pₘ↑ · MPLₘ↓ = Pₐ · MPLₐ↑

**Key insight**: w rises, but by less than the proportional increase in Pₘ

### Effects on Real Wages

#### Real Wage in Terms of Manufactures
w'/Pₘ↑ = MPLₘ↓ < w/Pₘ (original)

**Real wage falls** measured in manufactures.

#### Real Wage in Terms of Agriculture
w'/Pₐ = MPLₐ↑ > w/Pₐ (original)

**Real wage rises** measured in agriculture.

#### Overall Effect on Labor
**Ambiguous**: Workers can buy:
- Less manufactures
- More agriculture

Net welfare depends on consumption preferences.

### Effects on Specific Factors

#### Capital (Specific to Manufacturing)
**Return**: r' = (Pₘ↑ · Qₘ↑ - w'↑ · Lₘ↑)/K

- Revenue increases: Pₘ↑ · Qₘ↑
- Wage bill increases: w'↑ · Lₘ↑ (but w rises less than Pₘ)
- **Nominal return r increases**

**Real returns**:
- r'/Pₘ↑: Increases (since r rises more than proportionally to Pₘ)
- r'/Pₐ: Increases even more

**Capital owners unambiguously gain**.

#### Land (Specific to Agriculture)
**Return**: rₜ' = (Pₐ · Qₐ↓ - w'↑ · Lₐ↓)/T

- Revenue decreases: Pₐ · Qₐ↓ (output falls as Lₐ falls)
- Wage bill changes: w'↑ · Lₐ↓ (ambiguous)
- **Nominal return rₜ decreases**

**Real returns**:
- rₜ'/Pₘ↑: Decreases significantly
- rₜ'/Pₐ: Decreases

**Landowners unambiguously lose**.

## Summary of Price Increase Effects

### When Pₘ rises (Pₐ constant):

| Factor | Nominal Return | Real Return (Pₘ) | Real Return (Pₐ) | Overall |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Capital (K) | ↑↑ | ↑ | ↑↑ | **Gains** |
| Labor (L) | ↑ | ↓ | ↑ | **Ambiguous** |
| Land (T) | ↓ | ↓↓ | ↓ | **Loses** |

### General Principle
**Factor specific to expanding sector gains**
**Factor specific to contracting sector loses**
**Mobile factor has ambiguous effect**

## Numerical Example: Price Change Effects

**Initial Setup**:
- K = 100 (capital in manufacturing)
- T = 100 (land in agriculture)
- L = 200 (total labor)
- Production functions: Qₘ = √(K · Lₘ), Qₐ = √(T · Lₐ)
- Initial prices: Pₘ = Pₐ = $1
- Initial equilibrium: Lₘ = Lₐ = 100

**Initial Equilibrium Calculations**:
- Qₘ = √(100 × 100) = 100
- Qₐ = √(100 × 100) = 100
- MPLₘ = 0.5√(K/Lₘ) = 0.5√(100/100) = 0.5
- MPLₐ = 0.5√(T/Lₐ) = 0.5√(100/100) = 0.5
- Wage: w = Pₘ · MPLₘ = $1 × 0.5 = $0.50
- Capital return: r = (Pₘ·Qₘ - w·Lₘ)/K = ($100 - $50)/100 = $0.50
- Land return: rₜ = (Pₐ·Qₐ - w·Lₐ)/T = ($100 - $50)/100 = $0.50

**Shock: Pₘ increases to $1.20 (20% increase)**

**New Equilibrium**:
- Labor reallocates: Some Lₐ → Lₘ
- New equilibrium condition: 1.20 · MPLₘ = 1.00 · MPLₐ
- After solving: Lₘ ≈ 120, Lₐ ≈ 80 (labor shifts to manufacturing)
- New wage: w ≈ $0.548 (9.6% increase)
- New Qₘ ≈ 109.5, Qₐ ≈ 89.4

**Effects on Each Factor**:

*Capital (K)*:
- New return: r = (1.20 × 109.5 - 0.548 × 120)/100 ≈ $0.66
- Nominal: +32%
- Real (in terms of M): r/Pₘ = 0.66/1.20 = 0.55 (vs 0.50 before) → **+10%**
- Real (in terms of A): r/Pₐ = 0.66/1.00 = 0.66 (vs 0.50 before) → **+32%**
- **Unambiguously better off!** ✓

*Labor (L)*:
- Nominal wage: +9.6% (from $0.50 to $0.548)
- Real (in terms of M): w/Pₘ = 0.548/1.20 = 0.457 (vs 0.50) → **-8.6%** ✗
- Real (in terms of A): w/Pₐ = 0.548/1.00 = 0.548 (vs 0.50) → **+9.6%** ✓
- **Ambiguous**: Can buy less M, more A

*Land (T)*:
- New return: rₜ = (1.00 × 89.4 - 0.548 × 80)/100 ≈ $0.456
- Nominal: -8.8%
- Real (in terms of M): rₜ/Pₘ = 0.456/1.20 = 0.38 (vs 0.50) → **-24%** ✗
- Real (in terms of A): rₜ/Pₐ = 0.456/1.00 = 0.456 (vs 0.50) → **-8.8%** ✗
- **Unambiguously worse off!** ✗

**Key Insight**: Capital owners would lobby FOR trade if manufacturing is export sector; landowners would lobby AGAINST trade!

## Trade and Income Distribution

### Opening to Trade
Suppose Home has comparative advantage in manufactures:
- Autarky: (Pₘ/Pₐ)autarky is low
- Trade: (Pₘ/Pₐ)trade > (Pₘ/Pₐ)autarky
- This means Pₘ rises relative to Pₐ

### Winners and Losers from Trade
**Capital owners (K) gain**: Specific factor in export sector
**Landowners (T) lose**: Specific factor in import-competing sector
**Workers (L)**: Ambiguous - depends on consumption basket

### Political Economy Implications
1. **Specific factors have clear interests**: Export industries support free trade; import-competing industries oppose it
2. **Short-run vs. long-run**: In long run, factors may become mobile (moves toward HO model)
3. **Coalition formation**: Workers may ally with either capital or land depending on their consumption
4. **Compensation**: Gains from trade large enough to compensate losers, but compensation may not occur

## Production and Trade Pattern

### Relative Supply Curve
As Pₘ/Pₐ increases:
- Labor shifts from A to M
- Qₘ increases, Qₐ decreases
- **Relative supply Qₘ/Qₐ increases**

**RS curve**: Upward sloping (unlike Ricardian model where it's vertical)

### Trade Equilibrium
Combine with relative demand:
- RD curve: Downward sloping
- Intersection determines (Pₘ/Pₐ)trade and trade pattern

### Determining Comparative Advantage
Country with:
- Relatively more capital (K/T higher)
- Better technology in manufacturing
- Will export manufactures

## Welfare Analysis

### Aggregate Gains from Trade
**Production effect**: Move to production point with higher value at world prices

**Consumption effect**: Access to different consumption point than production

**Net effect**: Country gains from trade (national income increases)

### Distribution of Gains
Unlike Ricardian model, **not everyone gains**:
- Owners of export-sector specific factor: Large gains
- Owners of import-sector specific factor: Losses
- Mobile factor: Small gains, losses, or neutral

**Total gains > total losses**: Potential for Pareto improvement with redistribution

## Key Differences from Ricardian Model

| Feature | Ricardian | Specific Factors |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Factors | Labor only | Labor, capital, land |
| Factor mobility | Between sectors | Only labor mobile |
| PPF shape | Linear | Concave |
| Specialization | Complete | Incomplete |
| Income distribution | Everyone gains | Winners and losers |
| Time horizon | Long run | Short run |

## Mathematical Deep Dive

### Production Functions
Assume Cobb-Douglas:
- Qₘ = K^α · Lₘ^(1-α)
- Qₐ = T^β · Lₐ^(1-β)

### Marginal Products
- MPLₘ = (1-α) · K^α · Lₘ^(-α) = (1-α) · Qₘ/Lₘ
- MPLₐ = (1-β) · T^β · Lₐ^(-β) = (1-β) · Qₐ/Lₐ

### Equilibrium Condition
Pₘ · MPLₘ = Pₐ · MPLₐ

Pₘ · (1-α) · Qₘ/Lₘ = Pₐ · (1-β) · Qₐ/Lₐ

### Labor Allocation
This equation, combined with Lₘ + Lₐ = L, determines Lₘ and Lₐ.

### Factor Price Magnification
When Pₘ rises by 10%:
- r might rise by 30% (magnified effect)
- w might rise by 5% (muted effect)
- rₜ might fall by 10%

**Specific factors experience magnified price effects**.

## Applications

### Tariff Analysis
A tariff on imported agriculture:
- Raises Pₐ relative to Pₘ
- Benefits landowners
- Hurts capital owners
- Ambiguous effect on workers

### Immigration
Increase in L:
- Reduces w (more labor competition)
- Increases r and rₜ (more labor to work with specific factors)
- **Specific factor owners benefit from immigration**

### Technological Change
Technology improvement in manufacturing (K more productive):
- Shifts MPLₘ upward
- Attracts labor to manufacturing
- Increases relative supply of manufactures
- May change trade pattern

## Empirical Relevance

### Evidence Supporting the Model
1. **Short-run factor immobility**: Workers don't instantly switch sectors
2. **Industry-specific lobbying**: Trade policy coalitions form along industry lines
3. **Incomplete specialization**: Most countries produce in multiple sectors
4. **Adjustment costs**: Workers face costs when switching sectors

### Limitations
1. **Long run**: Factors eventually become mobile
2. **Multiple specific factors**: Real economies have many sector-specific factors
3. **Intermediate inputs**: Model ignores intermediate goods
4. **Technology**: Assumed fixed, not endogenous
