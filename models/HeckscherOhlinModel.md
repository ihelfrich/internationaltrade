# The Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) Model

> **Big Idea**: Trade is driven by differences in factor endowments (capital, labor, land). Capital-abundant countries export capital-intensive goods; labor-abundant countries export labor-intensive goods. Trade creates winners (abundant factor) and losers (scarce factor) along factor class lines, not industry lines.

---

## Core Principles

### Foundation
- **Factor Endowments Drive Trade**: Countries export goods that intensively use their abundant factors
  - USA (capital-abundant) exports aircraft; Bangladesh (labor-abundant) exports garments
  - Explains North-South trade patterns
- **Two Factors, Both Mobile**: Labor (L) and Capital (K) can move freely between sectors
  - Long-run assumption: workers can retrain, capital can be reallocated
  - Contrast: Specific Factors where factors are stuck
- **Long-Run Model**: All factors are mobile (contrast with Specific Factors short-run)
  - After adjustment period, factors find their most productive use
- **Identical Technologies**: Countries have access to the same production functions
  - Differences in trade come from endowments, not productivity
  - Strong assumption, but simplifies analysis
- **Factor Proportions**: Trade based on differences in relative factor endowments
  - Not absolute amounts, but K/L ratios matter

### Key Insight
**Source of comparative advantage**: Differences in factor endowments (not technology as in Ricardian)

**Political Economy**: Trade benefits your class (capital vs. labor), not your industry
- All capital owners support free trade in capital-abundant countries
- All workers oppose free trade in capital-abundant countries
- Creates class-based political coalitions

## Model Assumptions

### The "2×2×2" Framework
1. **Two countries**: Home and Foreign (Foreign denoted with *)
2. **Two goods**: Cloth (C) and Food (F)
3. **Two factors**: Labor (L) and Capital (K)

### Additional Assumptions
1. **Identical homothetic preferences** across countries
2. **Constant returns to scale** in production
3. **Perfect competition** in all markets
4. **No trade barriers** or transport costs
5. **Factors mobile between sectors**, immobile between countries
6. **Full employment** of all factors
7. **Identical technologies** across countries
8. **Different factor intensities** across goods

## Production Technology

### Factor Intensities
Define factor intensity by capital-labor ratio:

**Cloth is capital-intensive if**: Kc/Lc > Kf/Lf

**Food is labor-intensive if**: Kf/Lf < Kc/Lc

This ranking **must hold at all factor prices** (no factor intensity reversals).

### Production Functions
**Cloth**: Qc = Fc(Kc, Lc)
**Food**: Qf = Ff(Kf, Lf)

Both exhibit:
- Constant returns to scale
- Diminishing marginal products
- Positive marginal products

### Factor Market Clearing
**Capital**: Kc + Kf = K (total capital endowment)
**Labor**: Lc + Lf = L (total labor endowment)

## Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

### Shape
- **Concave** (bowed out), reflecting increasing opportunity cost
- Smoother than Specific Factors PPF (both factors mobile)

### Slope
**Slope of PPF** = -MCf/MCc = -Pf/Pc (in competitive equilibrium)

where MC denotes marginal cost.

### Rybczynski Theorem
**At constant goods prices**, if one factor endowment increases:
- Output of good using that factor intensively **increases more than proportionally**
- Output of other good **decreases in absolute terms**

#### Example
If K increases (holding L constant and Pf/Pc constant):
- Qc increases more than proportionally (cloth is capital-intensive)
- Qf decreases in absolute terms

#### Intuition
- Additional capital must be employed
- To maintain factor-price equality, need complementary labor
- Labor drawn from food sector
- Food output falls; cloth output rises substantially

## Factor Prices

### Zero-Profit Conditions
Perfect competition implies zero economic profits:

**Cloth**: Pc = ac,k · r + ac,l · w
**Food**: Pf = af,k · r + af,l · w

where:
- ac,k, ac,l are unit factor requirements for cloth
- af,k, af,l are unit factor requirements for food
- r is rental rate of capital
- w is wage rate

### Factor Price Equalization (FPE)
Under HO assumptions, **free trade equalizes factor prices across countries**:

- w = w* (wage equalization)
- r = r* (rental rate equalization)

#### Conditions for FPE
1. Both countries produce both goods (incomplete specialization)
2. Identical technologies
3. No trade costs
4. No factor intensity reversals
5. Factor endowments not too different

#### Intuition
- Goods prices equalize through trade
- Goods prices determine factor prices (via zero-profit conditions)
- Therefore, factor prices equalize

**"Trade in goods substitutes for trade in factors"**

### Stolper-Samuelson Theorem
**If the price of a good rises, the real return to the factor used intensively in that good rises, while the real return to the other factor falls.**

#### Mathematical Statement
If Pc rises (holding Pf constant):
- r/Pc rises and r/Pf rises (real rental rate increases)
- w/Pc falls and w/Pf falls (real wage decreases)

(Assuming cloth is capital-intensive)

#### Magnification Effect
The factor price changes are **magnified**:

If Pc rises by 10%:
- r might rise by 20% (magnified)
- w might fall by 5% (to maintain zero profits)

#### Proof Sketch
From zero-profit conditions:
- Pc = ac,k · r + ac,l · w
- Pf = af,k · r + af,l · w

If Pc rises and Pf constant:
- To maintain zero profit in cloth: r must rise and/or w must fall
- But if w rises, then Pf = af,k · r + af,l · w would be violated
- Therefore: r rises, w falls
- Magnification occurs to satisfy both equations

## Factor Endowments and Trade Pattern

### Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem
**A country exports the good that intensively uses its abundant factor and imports the good that intensively uses its scarce factor.**

#### Defining Factor Abundance
Two definitions (equivalent under HO assumptions):

**Physical definition**: Home is capital-abundant if
K/L > K*/L*

**Price definition**: Home is capital-abundant if
(r/w)autarky > (r/w*)autarky

#### Trade Pattern Prediction
If Home is capital-abundant and cloth is capital-intensive:
- Home exports cloth
- Foreign exports food

### Relative Supply and Demand

#### Relative Supply (RS)
At any Pf/Pc:
- Capital-abundant country produces higher Qc/Qf
- RS curve for capital-abundant country lies to the right

#### Relative Demand (RD)
With identical homothetic preferences:
- RD curve is the same for both countries
- Downward sloping

#### Autarky Prices
- Capital-abundant Home: (Pf/Pc)autarky higher (cloth relatively cheap)
- Labor-abundant Foreign: (Pf/Pc)autarky lower (food relatively cheap)

#### Trade Equilibrium
- (Pf/Pc)Home,autarky > (Pf/Pc)trade > (Pf/Pc)Foreign,autarky
- Home exports cloth (capital-intensive)
- Foreign exports food (labor-intensive)

## Income Distribution Effects

### Winners and Losers from Trade
Unlike Specific Factors, **factor type (not sector) determines gains/losses**:

**Capital-abundant country (Home) opens to trade**:
- Pc rises (exporting capital-intensive good)
- By Stolper-Samuelson: r rises, w falls
- **Capital owners gain**
- **Workers lose**

**Labor-abundant country (Foreign) opens to trade**:
- Pf rises (exporting labor-intensive good)
- By Stolper-Samuelson: w* rises, r* falls
- **Workers gain**
- **Capital owners lose**

### Key Insight
Trade benefits the abundant factor and hurts the scarce factor in each country.

**Political coalitions form along factor lines**, not industry lines:
- All capital owners support free trade in capital-abundant countries
- All workers oppose free trade in capital-abundant countries

## Leontief Paradox

### The Paradox
**Leontief (1953)** tested HO predictions using US data:
- US was capital-abundant
- HO predicts US exports should be capital-intensive
- **Finding**: US exports were labor-intensive!

### Explanations for Paradox
1. **Human capital**: US abundant in skilled labor (human capital), not just physical capital
2. **Factor intensity reversals**: Some goods change factor intensity at different prices
3. **Natural resources**: Need to include land/resources as third factor
4. **Technology differences**: US had superior technology (violates HO assumption)
5. **Demand bias**: US consumers may prefer capital-intensive goods
6. **Trade barriers**: Tariffs and quotas distort patterns

### Modern Evidence
More nuanced:
- HO works better when including human capital
- Works better for North-South trade (large endowment differences)
- Less successful for North-North trade (similar endowments)

## Extensions and Modifications

### More Than Two Factors
With labor, capital, and land:
- More complex predictions
- Factor price equalization less likely
- Specific Factors model may be more appropriate

### More Than Two Goods
- Countries may export multiple goods
- Prediction: Export goods intensive in abundant factors
- Allows for incomplete specialization more naturally

### More Than Two Countries
- Chain of comparative advantage
- Countries export different bundles based on endowments

### Intermediate Inputs
- Trade in parts and components
- Vertical specialization
- Complicates factor content calculations

### Increasing Returns to Scale
- Violates HO assumption
- Leads to "new trade theory" models
- Can generate trade between similar countries

## Factor Price Equalization in Detail

### The FPE Diagram
In factor price space (w, r):
- Each zero-profit condition is a downward-sloping line
- Intersection determines unique (w, r)
- If goods prices equal, factor prices equal

### FPE Cone
Range of factor endowments (K/L ratios) consistent with:
- Both countries producing both goods
- Factor price equalization

If endowments too different, countries specialize and FPE fails.

### Empirical Evidence on FPE
**Mixed**:
- Factor prices not fully equalized (wages differ greatly)
- But convergence observed in some contexts (EU integration)
- Trade costs, technology differences, and barriers prevent full FPE

## Integrated World Equilibrium

### Concept
Imagine world with:
- Free factor mobility (not just goods mobility)
- What would factor prices and allocation be?

### Comparison with Trade
**Factor price equalization**: Trade replicates integrated equilibrium
**Each country's production point** on its PPF matches factor employment in integrated equilibrium

### Breaking FPE
If countries too different:
- Specialization occurs
- Factor prices diverge
- Trade doesn't fully substitute for factor mobility

## Gains from Trade

### Production Gains
- Move to production point with higher value at world prices
- Exploit comparative advantage based on endowments

### Consumption Gains
- Access to world prices, not just autarky prices
- Consume beyond PPF

### National Income
- National income (measured at world prices) increases
- Total gains exceed total losses (potential Pareto improvement)

### Distribution
- Abundant factor gains more than scarce factor loses
- Redistribution could make everyone better off
- But redistribution often doesn't happen (political economy)

## Comparison Across Models

|---------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Source of trade | Technology | Mixed | Factor endowments |
| Number of factors | 1 (Labor) | 3 (L, K, T) | 2 (L, K) |
| Factor mobility | Between sectors | Labor only | Both factors |
| Time horizon | Long run | Short run | Long run |
| PPF shape | Linear | Concave | Concave |
| Specialization | Complete | Incomplete | Often incomplete |
| Winners from trade | Everyone | Sector-specific factors | Abundant factor |
| Losers from trade | None | Import-sector factor | Scarce factor |
| Political coalitions | N/A | Industry-based | Factor-based |

## Mathematical Deep Dive

### Production Functions (Cobb-Douglas Example)
**Cloth**: Qc = Kc^α · Lc^(1-α) with α > β (capital-intensive)
**Food**: Qf = Kf^β · Lf^(1-β) with β < α (labor-intensive)

### Cost Minimization
Minimize cost of producing one unit:

**Cloth**: min {r·kc + w·lc} subject to kc^α · lc^(1-α) = 1
**Food**: min {r·kf + w·lf} subject to kf^β · lf^(1-β) = 1

Yields unit cost functions:
- c(r, w) for cloth
- cf(r, w) for food

### Zero-Profit Conditions
- Pc = c(r, w)
- Pf = cf(r, w)

These two equations determine r and w given Pc and Pf.

### Factor Demands
From cost minimization:
- kc/lc = (α/(1-α)) · (w/r) (capital-labor ratio in cloth)
- kf/lf = (β/(1-β)) · (w/r) (capital-labor ratio in food)

Since α > β: kc/lc > kf/lf (cloth is capital-intensive).

### Full Employment
- Kc + Kf = K
- Lc + Lf = L

Combined with factor demands, determines (Kc, Lc, Kf, Lf).

### General Equilibrium
System of equations:
1. Zero profit in cloth: Pc = c(r, w)
2. Zero profit in food: Pf = cf(r, w)
3. Capital market clearing: Kc + Kf = K
4. Labor market clearing: Lc + Lf = L
5. Goods market clearing: Supply = Demand (determined by preferences)

Solves for: (r, w, Kc, Lc, Kf, Lf, Qc, Qf, Dc, Df, Exports, Imports)

## Policy Applications

### Tariffs
A tariff on food imports (in capital-abundant Home):
- Raises Pf
- By Stolper-Samuelson: w rises, r falls
- **Benefits scarce factor (labor)**
- **Hurts abundant factor (capital)**

**Political economy**: Scarce factor may lobby for protection.

### Immigration
Immigration of workers into capital-abundant Home:
- L increases
- By Rybczynski: Qf increases more than proportionally, Qc may fall
- At constant world prices: w falls, r rises (more workers per unit capital)
- **Capital owners benefit, incumbent workers hurt**

### Foreign Aid
Transfer of capital from Home to Foreign:
- Home K decreases, Foreign K* increases
- Changes production patterns
- May worsen Home's terms of trade if exports become scarcer

### Factor Market Policies
Minimum wage in labor-scarce country:
- Raises w above equilibrium
- Reduces labor demand
- Unemployment results
- Magnifies losses to workers from trade

## Empirical Testing

### Approaches
1. **Factor content of trade**: Calculate K/L embodied in exports vs. imports
2. **Net exports and endowments**: Regress net exports on factor endowments
3. **Gravity models**: Incorporate factor endowments into gravity framework

### Findings
**Successes**:
- Countries abundant in skilled labor export skill-intensive goods
- Natural resource endowments predict trade patterns
- Works better for extreme endowment differences

**Failures**:
- Simple 2×2×2 model too restrictive
- Need to account for technology differences
- Trade costs matter
- Increasing returns and product differentiation important

### Modern Approaches
- Multi-factor, multi-good models
- Incorporate technology differences
- Allow for trade costs
- Combine HO with "new trade theory"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Factor endowments drive trade** in the HO model
2. **Abundant factor gains from trade; scarce factor loses**
3. **Factor price equalization**: Trade can substitute for factor mobility
4. **Stolper-Samuelson**: Goods price changes have magnified effects on factor prices
5. **Rybczynski**: Factor endowment changes have magnified output effects
6. **Political economy**: Coalitions form along factor lines (capital vs. labor)
7. **Empirical evidence**: Mixed, works better with modifications
8. **Long-run model**: Both factors mobile (contrast with Specific Factors)

## Problem-Solving Framework

### Identifying Trade Patterns
1. Determine factor abundance: Compare K/L ratios
2. Determine factor intensity: Compare Kc/Lc vs. Kf/Lf
3. Apply HO theorem: Abundant factor's intensive good is exported

### Analyzing Price Changes
1. Identify which good's price changes
2. Determine factor intensity of that good
3. Apply Stolper-Samuelson: Intensive factor gains, other loses
4. Calculate magnification effects

### Analyzing Endowment Changes
1. Identify which factor increases
2. Determine which good uses that factor intensively
3. Apply Rybczynski: Intensive good output rises more than proportionally, other output falls

### Welfare Analysis
1. Calculate production changes (Rybczynski effects)
2. Calculate factor price changes (Stolper-Samuelson)
3. Identify winners: Abundant factor owners
4. Identify losers: Scarce factor owners
5. Calculate net gains (national income effect)
6. Consider redistribution possibilities

## Connection to Reality

### Developed vs. Developing Countries
**Developed** (capital-abundant):
- Export capital-intensive manufactures, services
- Workers may oppose free trade
- Capital owners support free trade

**Developing** (labor-abundant):
- Export labor-intensive manufactures, agriculture
- Workers may support free trade
- Capital owners may oppose free trade

### Globalization and Inequality
HO predicts:
- Rising inequality in capital-abundant countries (w falls, r rises)
- Falling inequality in labor-abundant countries (w rises, r falls)

Evidence partially supports this, but other forces matter:
- Skill-biased technological change
- Automation
- Trade in tasks (offshoring)

### Migration and Trade
HO suggests:
- Trade in goods can substitute for migration
- But FPE rarely perfect, so gains from migration remain
- Political economy: Scarce factor opposes both trade and immigration
