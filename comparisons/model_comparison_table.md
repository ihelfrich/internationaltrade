## Winners and Losers from Trade

### Ricardian Model
**Winners**:
- Everyone! All workers gain (or at least don't lose)
- Real wages rise for imported goods

**Losers**:
- None (in theory)

**Political Coalitions**:
- No conflict - universal support for trade
- Not realistic politically

**Why No Losers?**:
- Only one factor (labor)
- Perfect mobility between sectors
- All workers earn same wage

---

### Specific Factors Model
**Winners**:
- Owners of export sector specific factor (capital if manufacturing exports)
- Mobile factor (labor): ambiguous, depends on consumption basket

**Losers**:
- Owners of import-competing sector specific factor (land if agriculture imports)

**Political Coalitions**:
- **Industry-based coalitions**
- Export industries lobby FOR free trade
- Import-competing industries lobby AGAINST trade
- Workers may align with either side

**Example**:
- US opens to trade, exports manufactured goods
- Capital owners (manufacturing) gain ✓
- Landowners (agriculture) lose ✗
- Workers: ambiguous (can buy cheaper imports but wages may fall in real terms)

---

### Heckscher-Ohlin Model
**Winners**:
- Owners of abundant factor
- In capital-abundant country: capital owners gain
- In labor-abundant country: workers gain

**Losers**:
- Owners of scarce factor
- In capital-abundant country: workers lose
- In labor-abundant country: capital owners lose

**Political Coalitions**:
- **Class-based coalitions** (not industry-based!)
- All capital owners in capital-abundant countries support trade
- All workers in capital-abundant countries oppose trade
- Opposite in labor-abundant countries

**Example**:
- US (capital-abundant) opens to trade
- ALL capital owners gain (whether in tech, agriculture, or manufacturing) ✓
- ALL workers lose (whether in tech, agriculture, or manufacturing) ✗
- Explains North-South trade politics

## Model Assumptions Comparison

### Production Technology

| Model | Returns to Scale | Production Function | Key Feature |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Ricardian** | Constant | Q = L/a (linear) | Unit labor requirements |
| **Specific Factors** | Diminishing | Q = F(K,L) or G(T,L) | Fixed specific factors |
| **HO** | Constant | Q = F(K,L) with CRS | Identical across countries |

### Factor Markets

| Model | Factors | Mobility | Wage Determination |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Ricardian** | L only | Perfect between sectors | w = P/a |
| **Specific Factors** | L, K, T | L mobile; K, T specific | w = P·MPL |
| **HO** | L, K | Both mobile between sectors | Factor price equalization |

### Technology

| Model | Across Countries | Across Goods | Key Point |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Ricardian** | Different | Different | Source of comparative advantage |
| **Specific Factors** | Can differ | Can differ | Not the main focus |
| **HO** | **Identical** | **Identical** | Strong assumption! |

## When to Use Each Model

### Use Ricardian Model When:
- ✓ Explaining basic concept of comparative advantage
- ✓ Analyzing trade between countries with very different productivity levels
- ✓ Long-run analysis where all factors are mobile
- ✓ Teaching introductory students
- ✓ Highlighting technology differences (North-South trade)

**Best For**: Explaining why trade happens at all; showing mutual gains

**Limitations**: No distributional effects; unrealistic complete specialization

---

### Use Specific Factors Model When:
- ✓ Analyzing short-run adjustment to trade shocks
- ✓ Understanding political economy of trade policy
- ✓ Explaining industry-specific lobbying (steel tariffs, etc.)
- ✓ When factors can't quickly move between sectors
- ✓ Studying transition costs of trade liberalization

**Best For**: Political economy; short-run winners and losers; industry lobbying

**Limitations**: Not suitable for long-run analysis; many parameters needed

---

### Use Heckscher-Ohlin Model When:
- ✓ Analyzing long-run trade patterns
- ✓ Explaining North-South trade (developed vs. developing)
- ✓ Understanding class-based political coalitions
- ✓ Predicting effects of factor accumulation (capital growth, immigration)
- ✓ Examining wage convergence across countries

**Best For**: Long-run equilibrium; factor endowment-based trade; income distribution

**Limitations**: Empirically mixed results; strong assumptions (identical technology)

---

## Key Theorems by Model

### Ricardian Model
**Main Result**: Comparative Advantage Theorem
- Countries export goods with lower opportunity cost
- Mutual gains from trade even with absolute disadvantage

---

### Specific Factors Model
**Key Results**:
1. **Magnification Effect** (partial):
   - Specific factor in expanding sector gains more than proportionally
   - Specific factor in contracting sector loses

2. **Ambiguous Effect on Mobile Factor**:
   - Real wage rises in terms of one good, falls in terms of other
   - Net effect depends on consumption preferences

---

### Heckscher-Ohlin Model
**Four Key Theorems**:

1. **Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem**:
   - Countries export goods intensive in abundant factors

2. **Factor Price Equalization (FPE)**:
   - Free trade equalizes factor prices across countries

3. **Stolper-Samuelson Theorem**:
   - Increase in price of good raises real return to intensive factor
   - Magnification: factor prices change MORE than goods prices

4. **Rybczynski Theorem**:
   - Increase in factor endowment increases output of intensive good more than proportionally
   - Other good's output falls in absolute terms

---

## Empirical Performance

### Ricardian Model
**Successes**:
- ✓ Countries do export goods where they have high productivity
- ✓ Export prices correlate with labor requirements
- ✓ Explains some North-South trade

**Failures**:
- ✗ Predicts complete specialization (rarely observed)
- ✗ No distributional predictions to test
- ✗ Ignores other factors of production

**Verdict**: Good first approximation; limited predictive power

---

### Specific Factors Model
**Successes**:
- ✓ Explains industry-specific lobbying for protection
- ✓ Short-run adjustment costs are real
- ✓ Workers don't instantly switch sectors
- ✓ Industry trade associations match predictions

**Failures**:
- ✗ Difficult to test directly (short-run model)
- ✗ Hard to measure factor specificity
- ✗ Long-run irrelevant

**Verdict**: Excellent for political economy; hard to test empirically

---

### Heckscher-Ohlin Model
**Successes**:
- ✓ Labor-abundant countries export labor-intensive goods (with human capital)
- ✓ Natural resource endowments predict trade
- ✓ Works for North-South trade

**Failures**:
- ✗ **Leontief Paradox**: US (capital-abundant) exported labor-intensive goods!
- ✗ Factor price equalization fails empirically
- ✗ Technology differs across countries
- ✗ Weak for North-North trade

**Verdict**: Mixed; works better with multiple factors and human capital

## Real-World Examples

### Ricardian: US-China Tech Trade
- US has absolute advantage in semiconductors AND textiles
- But US has comparative advantage in semiconductors (higher productivity ratio)
- China has comparative advantage in textiles
- Both gain from specialization and trade

---

### Specific Factors: US Steel Tariffs (2018)
- US imposed tariffs on steel imports
- **Winners**: US steel producers (specific capital in steel)
- **Losers**: Foreign steel producers; US steel-using industries (autos, construction)
- **Ambiguous**: US steel workers (higher wages but higher cost of living)
- Political coalition: Steel industry (capital + labor) lobbied FOR tariffs

---

### HO: US-Bangladesh Trade
- US: capital-abundant; Bangladesh: labor-abundant
- US exports aircraft (capital-intensive); imports garments (labor-intensive)
- In US: capital owners gain, workers may lose from trade
- In Bangladesh: workers gain, capital owners may lose
- Explains why US labor unions sometimes oppose free trade agreements
