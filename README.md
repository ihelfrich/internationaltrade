## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains comprehensive notes on the three foundational models of international trade theory:

1. **Ricardian Model** - Understanding comparative advantage and the gains from trade
2. **Specific Factors Model** - Analyzing short-run effects and distributional impacts
3. **Heckscher-Ohlin Model** - Exploring factor endowments and long-run trade patterns

Each model is presented with:
- ✅ Clear theoretical foundations
- ✅ Step-by-step numerical examples
- ✅ Real-world applications
- ✅ Political economy insights
- ✅ Problem-solving frameworks
- ✅ Exam preparation tips

## 📖 Models Covered

### 1. The Ricardian Model
**Big Idea**: Trade is driven by differences in technology/productivity. Even if one country is absolutely better at producing everything, both countries benefit from trade based on **comparative advantage**.

**Key Topics**:
- Comparative vs. absolute advantage
- Opportunity costs and production possibilities
- Complete specialization
- Terms of trade
- Mutual gains from trade

### 2. The Specific Factors Model
**Big Idea**: In the short run, some factors are stuck in particular industries. Trade creates winners and losers based on which industry you're in, explaining why some industries lobby for protection while others support free trade.

**Key Topics**:
- Factor specificity and mobility
- Diminishing returns and concave PPF
- Stolper-Samuelson effects (specific factors version)
- Winners and losers from trade
- Political economy of trade policy

### 3. The Heckscher-Ohlin Model
**Big Idea**: Trade is driven by differences in factor endowments. Capital-abundant countries export capital-intensive goods; labor-abundant countries export labor-intensive goods. Trade benefits abundant factors and hurts scarce factors.

**Key Topics**:
- Factor endowments and factor intensities
- Factor Price Equalization theorem
- Stolper-Samuelson theorem
- Rybczynski theorem
- Leontief paradox
- Class-based political coalitions

## 📝 How to Use These Notes

### Study Sequence
We recommend studying the models in order:

1. **Start with Ricardian Model** - Establishes the fundamental concept of comparative advantage
2. **Move to Specific Factors** - Introduces distributional effects and multiple factors
3. **Finish with Heckscher-Ohlin** - Comprehensive long-run framework

### Reading Each Model
Each model note follows this structure:

1. **Big Idea** - One-sentence summary
2. **Core Principles** - Key assumptions and foundations
3. **Model Setup** - Mathematical formulation
4. **Equilibrium Analysis** - Autarky and trade equilibria
5. **Numerical Examples** - Step-by-step calculations
6. **Theorems and Results** - Key findings (Stolper-Samuelson, etc.)
7. **Applications** - Real-world implications
8. **Comparison with Other Models** - How it differs
9. **Problem-Solving Framework** - How to approach exam questions

## 🎓 For Students

### Exam Preparation
- **Numerical Examples**: Each model includes fully worked examples showing all steps
- **Problem-Solving Frameworks**: Templates for approaching different question types
- **Key Takeaways**: Summary sections highlight exam-worthy concepts
- **Comparison Tables**: Quickly review differences between models

### Study Tips
1. Work through numerical examples with pen and paper
2. Understand the intuition, not just the math
3. Draw graphs as you read (PPFs, supply/demand, etc.)
4. Focus on who wins/loses from trade in each model
5. Practice explaining concepts in your own words

### Common Pitfalls
- ⚠️ Don't confuse comparative advantage with absolute advantage
- ⚠️ Remember: Specific Factors is short-run, HO is long-run
- ⚠️ In HO, factor type matters (capital vs. labor), not industry
- ⚠️ Trade prices must lie between autarky prices for mutual gains
