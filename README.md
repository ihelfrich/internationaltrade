## Overview
This repository is designed for *teaching* international trade. It is organized as four layers:

1. **Lectures** — long-form, walked-through lectures with math and intuition.
2. **Notes** — dense, comprehensive model notes for students.
3. **Slides** — polished deck for classroom delivery.
4. **Interactive Lab** — calculators and demos for intuition-building.
