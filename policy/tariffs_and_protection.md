# Tariffs and Protection

## Supply, Demand, and World Prices
- In a small country, the world price P* is taken as given.
- Imports at P*: M = Q_D(P*) - Q_S(P*).
- A tariff raises the domestic price to P* + t.

## Effects of a Tariff (Small Country)
- Consumer surplus falls.
- Producer surplus rises.
- Government collects tariff revenue.
- Net welfare falls by deadweight loss (production + consumption distortion).

### Deadweight Loss (Small Country)
- DWL = 0.5 * t * (delta Q_D + delta Q_S)
- No terms-of-trade gain, so the whole effect is a loss.

## Large Country Tariff (Conceptual)
- If the country is large, the world price can fall.
- The terms-of-trade gain may offset some domestic distortions.
- The optimal tariff balances these forces (not recommended in practice due to retaliation risk).

## Effective Rate of Protection (ERP)
ERP = (t_f - a * t_i) / (1 - a)

Where:
- t_f = tariff on final good
- t_i = tariff on imported inputs
- a = share of imported inputs in the final good's value

Key insight: ERP can exceed the nominal tariff when inputs are lightly taxed.

## Measuring Protection
- Nominal tariff rates (ad valorem or specific).
- Ad valorem equivalents for quotas and standards.
- Coverage ratios: share of trade lines affected.
- Price wedge: domestic price minus world price.

## Short-Run vs Long-Run Costs
Short run:
- Output and employment shift toward protected sectors.
- Input costs rise for downstream producers.
- Retaliation reduces export demand.

Long run:
- Slower productivity growth from reduced competition.
- Resource misallocation persists.
- Innovation and diffusion slow down.

## Evidence and U.S. Tariffs (2018-2020)
- Broad tariffs led to higher import prices and large pass-through.
- Retaliation targeted U.S. exports, especially agriculture.
- Real income effects were negative once retaliation and higher input costs are included.

See the slides for specific figures and sources.

## Teaching Flow
1. Use the supply-demand diagram with P* and P*+t.
2. Show DWL triangles and tariff revenue rectangle.
3. Contrast small vs large country logic.
4. Explain ERP with a simple input-cost example.
5. Connect to real tariffs and distributional effects.
